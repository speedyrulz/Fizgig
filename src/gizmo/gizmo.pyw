"""Gizmo launcher — double-click to run without a console window.

The same shape as launch.pyw, and for the same reason: pythonw.exe hides the console, which
also hides FAILURES. If the app dies on import the window simply never appears — no error, no
clue. So every startup failure is reported through two channels that cannot themselves depend on
what broke: a native Windows message box via ctypes (deliberately not a Tkinter dialog, since
missing Tkinter is the classic cause) and gizmo_error.log in Fizgig's user_data folder.

Gizmo has no dependency Fizgig does not already have — Tkinter is stdlib, PIL and imageio-ffmpeg
are pinned in requirements.txt — so this needs no install of its own and nothing to re-run.
