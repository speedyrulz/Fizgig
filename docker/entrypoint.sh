Put your training images here.

Make one folder per LoRA, e.g.  /workspace/datasets/my_subject/
and put the images and their .txt caption files in it together.

Upload by dragging a folder into the file manager on port 8080, then on Fizgig's
Start tab click Browse and pick your folder under /workspace/datasets. Or use
the web UI on port 8081: Start tab -> Upload a training folder puts it here.

Everything under /workspace lives on your persistent volume, so it survives
stopping and restarting the pod. Anything outside /workspace does not.
